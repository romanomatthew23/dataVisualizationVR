CS498SL: Virtual Reality Final Project by Matthew Romano and Sifan Wang

## 1) Hardware

This was developed with an Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2), but the latest adjustments have been done testing with a GearVR. It should work for both, and probably the Consumer Version (CV1) as well.

## 2) Software

Created using Unity (version 5.1 or later should be fine) and some default Oculus Plugins.

## 3) Project

This project demonstrates the potential for VR to be used to aid in understanding data by seeing it in 3D. There are 3 examples included:
* A graph where random points can be generated in it
* A graph where the RRT path-planning algorithm is animated
* (not working right now) The [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_locale_id=en;&chart-type=bubbles) dataset

## 4) To Do

* Fix the "Gapminder" dataset portion
* Make the RRT Algorithm slower, show sampling, use different colors, etc.
* Add audio instructions?
* Delete all of the extra Visual Studio Files?
